claire 4.0 starts on September 6th, 2020

Dir organization is similar to CLAIRE vX.Y but

(1) the "trans" directory contains CLAIRE 3.5 code to compile CLAIRE 4.0 *.cl file
(2) the bin & code (libs and .cpp) are gone, replaced with gofiles (*.go that requires moving to golang GOPATH)

to set the GOPATH dir
GOPATH=/Users/ycaseau/claire/v4.0/go

There are multiple go* subdirectories:

(1) go1 is where we create "claire1" : simple interpreter from CLAIRE3.5 + trans compiler
(2) go2 is for claire2: complete interpreter/compiler from claire1 (interpreted compiler)
(3) go3 is for claire3: claire system obtained from claire2 (compiled compiler)
(3) go4 is for claire4: fixed point  compile_X(souce_X) = X


ginit is a bash file to setup the git
